##### **By Chris Wong**
-----
### <ins> **Requirement Definition** <ins>
The code enables the users to find information on different type of pokemons through the systems code.

---
### <ins> **Functional Requirements** <ins>
**Data Retrieval: What does the user need to be able to view in the system?**\
The user will need to download the required datapacks for the code.\
**User Interface: What is required for the user to interact with the system?**\
The user will need to be able to open up terminal and type in required functions into it.\
**Data Display: What information does the user need to obtain from the system?**\
The user obtains pokemon  from the system

---
### <ins> **Non-Functional Requirements** <ins>
**Data Retrieval: What does the user need to be able to view in the system?**\
The user will need to view the termanal that allows them to find out what they want to know in the system\
**Reliability: How reliable does the system and data need to be?**\
The system needs to be relaiable and up to date\
**Usability and Accessibility: How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?**\
We need instructions for the commands that will need to be inputed into the terminal

## <ins> **Determining Specifications** <ins>
### <ins> **Functional Specifications** <ins>
#### <ins> User Requirements <ins>

- What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.
    - The user will need to be literate and know how to type. They will also have to know about ____

#### <ins> Inputs & Outputs <ins>

- What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?
    - The system will accept the given the commands and it will output what the command ask it to do

#### <ins> Core Features <ins>

- At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?
    - The program has to return what the user command is unless it is something that is not included in program

#### <ins> User Interaction <ins>

- How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?
    - The user uses the terminal(command line) 
#### <ins> Error Handling <ins>

- What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
    - Errors that can be faced is if the user captalise or doesnt capitalise some words in the command 
---
### <ins> **Non-Functional Specifications** <ins>
- What would improve the system but is ultimately not required?
    - Ways to improve the system is making 

#### <ins> Performance <ins>

- How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?
    - We should try to get the system to peform the task as soon as the user types the command

#### <ins> Useability / Accessibility <ins>

- How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?
    - The accessibility can improve by adding functions that allow people who have disabilities to use it.

####  <ins> Reliability <ins>

- What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Duplicate data? API retrieval crash?
    - Duplicate of data could be a problem if it is called and changes the format to make the users harder to use
